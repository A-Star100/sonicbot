# Keys (Sonic GT only)

- Forwards: Up Arrow 
- Backwards: Down Arrow
- Left: Left Arrow
- Right: Right Arrow

- Trick System: Z key
- Stomp: B key

## Why is it mapped this way?
Due to the quirks of macOS, and our commitment to cross platform, we do this to avoid macOS issues. For example, if you press D a lot on macOS, it takes you out of the game and uses Dictation, which is
NOT something you would want in a game, and the original E key for stomping meant repetitive prompts to use the emojis. As for the trick system remapping, that was just to avoid further random issues.
